This project is a web application that allows users to automatically create a transcript of a video by uploading the video. It also allows users to change the audio of the video and produce a new video with a changed voiceover. The application also has a section where a mentor can update his/her details and post courses that users can enroll in and watch in multiple languages at once.

# Usage

## Transcript Creation
To create a transcript of a video, the user needs to upload the video to the application. The application will then use Google Speech-to-Text API to generate a transcript of the video. Once the transcript is generated, the user can download it in the form of a text file.
